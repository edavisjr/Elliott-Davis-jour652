    <div class="intro-text">Just over a year after not one, but two Category 5 hurricanes hit the U.S. Virgin Islands, the tourism high season has arrived. Just how badly did the storms damage the territory’s industry, and what are the expectations heading into the new season?</div>

      The Hurricanes</div>

      <p>In September of 2017, disaster struck the U.S. Virgin Islands. The U.S. territory was hit by two Category 5 hurricanes, Irma and Maria, in the span of two weeks. Scott Bunn, the general manager of the Pirate Treasure Museum who lives on the territory’s island of St. Thomas, could remember the “mad scramble” to prepare and the height of the strength of Hurricane Irma, the first storm to hit the USVI.</p>

      <p>“It was a very trying time,” Bunn said. “It was just amazing the amount of devastation that was here in that two-hour time period. We weren’t able to get out of the house for about three days.”</p>

      </div>

      <p>Now more than a year after the storms, the U.S. Virgin Islands tourism industry is starting to rebound. Officials are optimistic about the progress that has been made and the initiatives that are underway to ensure a successful 2018-19 tourism season, which coincides with the winter months for the United States mainland and other parts of the world.</p>

      <p>Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which both hit the USVI in September of 2017, damaged more than 90% of the territory’s above-ground power lines and knocked down more than half of its power poles, according to the government’s First-Year Progress Report. It took months for power to be restored in parts of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The report also noted that more than 23,000 households were damaged by the hurricanes, and nearly a quarter of housing structures sustained “severe” damages.</p>

        The Impact</div>

      <p>In addition to the human impact of the storms, the territory’s economy—specifically its tourism industry—was dealt a blow in the aftermath. The Progress Report estimates that the total economic impact of the hurricanes amounted to $1.54 billion, which adds up to approximately 40% of the territory’s GDP. Approximately 4,300 unemployment claims were filed after the storms.</p>

      <p>It took weeks for the territory’s two airports, Cyril E. King International Airport on St. Thomas and Henry E. Rohlsen Airport on St. Croix, to reopen and both sustained major damages. The first post-hurricane cruise ship did not dock in the territory until Nov. 3, 2017—over a month after the islands were hit. </p>

       <h2>The loss of hotel rooms</h2>
       <p>The USVI's hotels were among the many buildings and structures severely damaged by the hurricanes. The Territory lost approximately 68% of its hotel rooms after the storms. Many of the Territory's major hotels -- including the Marriott Frenchman's Reef on St. Thomas and Caneel Bay on St. John -- will not reopen until late 2019 or 2020.</p>

      <p>Hotel reservations were down 78% in December—a usually-busy tourism month for the islands—compared to the year before, according to the Progress Report. According to a USVI Bureau of Economic Research impact assessment report secured for this story, the territory lost over 68% of its hotel rooms after the hurricanes. The government’s Progress Report also notes that five major hotels—which are among the 10 largest employers in the territory—were damaged and closed last year, and none will reopen until 2019 at the earliest. </p>

      <p>Additionally, direct flight seats per week were down anywhere from 36-60% on a monthly basis throughout 2018, according to the Bureau of Economic Research. The bureau’s reports also note that until September, cruise passenger arrivals were lower each month than in 2017.</p>

      <p>“We are rebuilding much of our infrastructure with an eye to the future,” USVI Governor Kenneth E. Mapp said in a press release coupled with the First-Year Progress Report. “Resiliency and sustainability are what’s critical.”</p>

        The State of Tourism</div>

      <p>It did not take long for territory officials to attempt to get the tourism industry back on track. According to Luana Wheatley, the film office director for the USVI Department of Tourism, a marketing campaign called “Still Nice” was launched to change the conversation in the aftermath of the hurricanes. She said that the campaign “was put into the marketplace to let visitors know that we might be a bit bruised but still nice.”</p>

      <p>Wheatley also credited Airbnb for being “huge” for the territory with so many hotels closed. The home-sharing company ranked the USVI as its No. 1 Caribbean destination in October, according to a press release. The release noted that the territory saw a 600% increase in Airbnb bookings compared to 2017.</p>

        <br>

      <p>Data show that the USVI’s tourism economy is recovering. The Progress Report notes that more than 50% of hotel accommodations are now open and in June, air passenger capacity returned to 57% of the previous year’s capacity. Initiatives are underway to rebuild and improve the territory’s tourism product. Both airports are being modernized and the government is also funding projects to deepen St. Thomas and St. Croix’s harbors in effort to allow for more and bigger cruise ships to dock in the territory.</p>

        <h2>The loss of air visitors</h2>
        <p>Hurricanes Irma and Maria dealt a blow to the U.S. Virgin Islands' tourism industry. Air visitor numbers have been down dramatically each month throughout 2018 compared to the year prior, especially during the "high season" in the winter months.</p>

      <p>"We have been working diligently to rebuild and revamp our tourism product, and we are encouraged that our efforts to increase overnight visitors to the USVI are bearing fruit,” Beverly Nicholson-Doty, the territory’s commissioner of tourism, said in a press release.</p>

      <p>Reached via email, the commissioner did caution that with approximately half of the USVI’s hotels still closed, expectations of returning to normal visitor numbers for the upcoming high season are “not realistic.”</p>

      <p>Bunn also touched on the territory’s shortage of hotel rooms. “While the ships provide one type of guest for us, the hotels provide another,” he said. “Without the major hotels here right now, that is something that the island is missing.”</p>

      </div>

      <p>However, there do seem to be reasons for some optimism. Kayak.com web searches for trips to the USVI around the holiday season have increased 25% compared to the 2017-18 season, according to a Department of Tourism press release. Bunn said that with the upcoming tourism high season being the first for his business, the Pirate Treasure Museum, he was feeling confident despite the lack of hotel rooms.</p>

      <p>“I think it’s going to be a great season for everyone,” he said. “The ship schedule is very positive. There’s actually more calls this year than we’ve had in recent years. I think everyone, as far as all the other business and owners that I’m in the area with, they’re all very optimistic about this year.”</p>

      <p>Other officials, such as USVI Hotel & Tourism Association President Lisa Hamilton, are hopeful about the upcoming season and the territory’s tourism prospects beyond that.</p>

      <p>“Our independent and smaller hotels are having a record setting year with the limited inventory,” Hamilton said.</p>

      <p>Hamilton also noted that by the second quarter of 2020, most of the USVI’s hotels will be open and renovated.</p>

      <p>“Our product will be the best it ever has been,” Hamilton added. “That is very exciting as we are being told our hotels were dated and needed renovating for a few years now.”</p>

        <br>

      <p>Clifford Graham, the president of The West Indian Company Limited which manages the main cruise ship port on St. Thomas, is also optimistic and said that he believes the industry is “on the rebound.”</p>

      <p>“The USVI continues to add more attractions to make the island a more appealing tourism market,” Graham said. “Statistics show that a large amount of our passengers are repeated passengers, thus the need to continuously refresh our excursion offerings is ongoing.”  </p>

      <p>“We can see that with the continued growth of the cruise ship market, the U.S. Virgin Islands will have to continue to receive ramped up cruise ship calls into the future,” he added. “Additional berthing capacity must be built to grow the market share.  Accordingly, WICO along with the Virgin Islands Port Authority and the Department of Tourism, all under the Ports of the Virgin Islands, have studied the need for additional berthing and are ready to have that discussion with the community and various stakeholders as to a path forward.”</p>

      <p>As far as the status of the U.S. Virgin Islands beyond its tourism economy goes, Bunn said that the territory has “steadily moved forward.”</p>

      <p>“We’re still in a lot of recovery mode, still a lot of homes very damaged,” he said. “But every day is a better day than it was yesterday.”</p>
